# restrictionsEscaper
Escape restrictions imposed by your institution using ssh


## How

Download the `installer.sh` shell script on your machine and run it.

It should do things by itself.

If you encounter a permission error, paste the script content in a terminal that support multi-line input (warp for instance)

Once it's done, reboot your computer.

You can use a shortcut to quickly launch Edge if needed.

Here is the command (you can replace edge by chrome)
```
open -a "Microsoft Edge" --args --proxy-server=socks5://127.0.0.1:8080
```




## Requirements
You need a SSH server. The closest to you is the better.
You need an unblocked connection to Github for the script to self-update itself.

You also need Edge or any chromium based browser.
This was only tested on Mac and will only work on Mac for now.
