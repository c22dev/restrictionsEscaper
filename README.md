# restrictionsEscaper
Escape restrictions imposed by your institution using ssh


## Requirements
You need a SSH server. The closest to you is the better.
You need an unblocked connection to Github for the script to self-update itself.

Once you have your username, your password and your server, store them in the matching files :
```
user
pass
server
```
Make sure you only do it in 1 line.

You also need Edge or any chromium based browser.
This was only tested on Mac and will only work on Mac for now.
